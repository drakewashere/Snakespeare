# Snakespeare

## Summary
Snakespeare is the latest in human to snake communication technology.
By specifying the genus for known snakes, a higher level of communication can be achieved.
Snake genus translations are stored as class instances in "characters.py".

## Inspiration
The first step to communicating with snakes is teaching them classic English literature.
The fundamental principle of this was based on a similar project to teach horses about metaphysics and philosophy.
